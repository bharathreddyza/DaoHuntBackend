# Daohunt analytics and discovery tool

daohunt is an decntralised analytic tool creating dao data api using orbitDB ipfs database
we use covalent api and the graph to query data from the blockchain and snapshot proposals ,votes
Our backend is designed in a way to that all the reviews and user interactions with the daos are stored in a decentralised database on orbitDb which anyone can access and integrate in their projects
This is a proof of concepts as orbitDB is not completely built yet
